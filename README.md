# LinearRegression
Application to utilize Machine Learning libraries in Python and linear regression supervised learning to predict profits of ice cream sales according to the temperature. I am using a data set to feed it and a test data set.

# Mathamatics Applied
Y = mx + b
Scikit-Learn library in Python will help me configure a linear regression model to the dataset I provide (temp and ice cream sales).
It uses the method of least squares, which squares the distance in units between the data point, and the line build between the data points, (the accurate values). This will establish a heavier weight on the higher errors, which helps put more emphasis on higher errors and minimize the threshold.
