# LinearRegression
Creating very first python project where I will utilize Python Machine Learning libraries to generate my own supervised ML application. It will take user input of a house's size and predict it's cost. This will obviously not be 100% accurate since there can be hundereds of variables to truly affect cost, but it is merely to learn and practice.
